# :speech_balloon: Chat

Just my personal implementation of a chat application. I'm doing this in order to be better with the library socket.io and Node.js in general.

## :gear: Involved technologies

- Node.js
  - express
  - socket.io
- ReactJS

## :zap: Running the application

If it's your wish to see the chat running, you need to go to both backend and web folders and type that on the terminal:

> npm install

After that, again, run the following code on the terminal inside both directories:

> npm start

Finally, it's done. You can access the chat on your machine by accessing **localhost:3000** and see it working. In case you want to access the chat in more than a single machine, you should go to the connection part on the web project and change the ip from "localhost" to "your_machine_ip".
